<p2> Olympics has begin and there is so much to watch but it leaves you leaving from a south african point of view that 
I should rather be at the staduim at the event. A lot of participants have been brought all over the world to unity under 
Japan olympics to achieve the greatest potential. To what end should the tournament be presented to a beautiful scale for 
audience around planet earth and the space. CORONAVIRUS may be an issues but strict rules have made people the organisation
Toyko same of the most stuning street in Japan that I have seen in the 
ko be movies mara how can I let it, It is interesting will help those that a suffering. Some countries have could dominated in the table so much that it.
